# Former community driven Python repository

The community approach did not really work out. This repo will be closed. Please send PR to the main Pyhton repo.

This is where you (dev) can puplish your extensions and also where you (user) can find a bunch of nifty workflows.

Note that this repo is not necessarily peer reviewed.

Further there are some technical aspects of this repo. GitHub packs _all_ PRs into the repos refspecs, which lead to an explosion in size of the official python repo. This repo tries to avoid this kind of problems.
